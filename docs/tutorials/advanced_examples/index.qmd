# Advanced Examples

These notebooks showcase more specialized and advanced use cases in BoFire. These examples are not necessarily better strategies, but represent more complex uses of components within the library.

## Available Tutorials

### [Custom SOBO](custom_sobo.ipynb)
Create custom single-objective Bayesian optimization strategies.

### [Desirability Objectives](desirability_objectives.ipynb)
Working with desirability functions for multi-criteria optimization.

### [Genetic Algorithm](genetic_algorithm.ipynb)
Using genetic algorithms for optimization in BoFire.

### [Merging Objectives](merging_objectives.ipynb)
