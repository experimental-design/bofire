Creating experimental designs using explicit model formulas.

### [Fractional Factorial Designs](fractional_factorial.ipynb)
Efficient screening designs using fractional factorial approaches.

### [N-Choose-K Constraints](nchoosek_constraint.ipynb)
Handling n-choose-k constraints in experimental designs.

### [Optimality Criteria](optimality_criteria.ipynb)
