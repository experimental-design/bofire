# Design of Experiments

These tutorials demonstrate the usage of traditional design of experiments algorithms implemented in BoFire, including optimal designs and factorial designs.

## Available Tutorials

Introduction to basic design of experiments concepts and implementations.

### [Design with Explicit Formula](design_with_explicit_formula.qmd)
Creating experimental designs using explicit model formulas.

### [Fractional Factorial Designs](fractional_factorial.qmd)
Efficient screening designs using fractional factorial approaches.

### [N-Choose-K Constraints](nchoosek_constraint.qmd)
Handling n-choose-k constraints in experimental designs.

### [Optimality Criteria](optimality_criteria.qmd)
Using different optimality criteria (D-optimal, A-optimal, etc.) for design generation.
