# BoFire
BoFire is a **B**ayesian **O**ptimization **F**ramework **I**ntended for **R**eal **E**xperiments. 

Why BoFire?

BoFire ...

- supports mixed continuous, discrete and categorical parameter spaces for system inputs and outputs,
- separates objectives (minimize, maximize, close-to-target) from the outputs on which they operate,
- supports different specific and generic constraints as well as black-box output constraints,
- provides sampling methods for constrained mixed variable spaces,
- json-serializes problems for use in RESTful APIs and json/bson DBs,
- allows easy out of the box usage of strategies for single and multi-objective Bayesian optimization, and 
- provides a high flexibility on the modelling side if needed.

## Installation

BoFire has BoTorch as its main dependency which depends on PyTorch. In the following you find different options to install BoFire and its dependencies.

### Latest stable release

We do not recommend the latest stable release from PyPI until we have published version [0.1](https://github.com/experimental-design/bofire/milestone/1). 

### Current main branch

```

### Development installation
If you want to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) to BoFire, you might want to install in editable mode including the test dependencies.
After cloning the repository via
```
git clone https://github.com/experimental-design/bofire.git
```
and cd `bofire`, you can proceed with
```
pip install -e .[testing]
```
