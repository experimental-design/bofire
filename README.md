## **BoFire** â€” **B**ayesian **O**ptimization **F**ramework **I**ntended for **R**eal **E**xperiments

BoFire is a powerful Python package that serves as a comprehensive framework for experimental design. BoFire is designed to empower researchers, data scientists, engineers, and enthusiasts who are venturing into the world of Design of Experiments (DoE) and Bayesian optimization (BO) techniques.

Why BoFire? BoFire ...

- supports mixed continuous, discrete and categorical parameter spaces for system inputs and outputs,
- separates objectives (minimize, maximize, close-to-target) from the outputs on which they operate,
- supports different specific and generic constraints as well as black-box output constraints,
- can provide flexible DoEs that fulfill constraints,
- provides sampling methods for constrained mixed variable spaces,
- serializes problems for use in RESTful APIs and json/bson DBs, and
- allows easy out of the box usage of strategies for single and multi-objective Bayesian optimization.

## Getting started

In our [docs](https://experimental-design.github.io/bofire/), you can find all different options for the [BoFire installation](https://experimental-design.github.io/bofire/install/). For basic BoFire Bayesian optimization features using [BoTorch](https://botorch.org/) which depends on
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), you need to run

```
pip install bofire[optimization]
```

For a more complete introduction to BoFire, please look in our [docs](https://experimental-design.github.io/bofire/).

### Optimization problem

You will find a notebook covering the described example below in our [tutorials](https://github.com/experimental-design/bofire/tree/main/tutorials/quick_start) section to run the code yourself.

Let us consider a test function for single-objective optimization - the [Himmelblau's function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himmelblau%27s_function). The Himmelblau's function has four identical local minima used to test the performance of optimization algorithms. The optimization domain of the Himmelblau's function is illustrated below together with the four minima marked red.

</div>


### Defining the optimization output

Let's consider the single continuous output variable *y* of the Himmelblau's function with the objective to minimize it. In BoFire's terminology, we create a `MinimizeObjective` object to define the optimization objective of a `Continuous Output` feature.

```Python
from bofire.data_models.features.api import ContinuousOutput
from bofire.data_models.objectives.api import MinimizeObjective


objective = MinimizeObjective()
output_feature = ContinuousOutput(key="y", objective=objective)
```

For more details on `Output` features and `Objective` objects, see the respective sections in our [docs](https://experimental-design.github.io/bofire/).


### Defining the optimization inputs

For the two continuous input variables of the Himmelblau's function *x1* and *x2*, we create two `ContinuousInput` features including boundaries following BoFire's terminology.

```Python
from bofire.data_models.features.api import ContinuousInput


input_feature_1 = ContinuousInput(key="x1", bounds=[-5, 5])
input_feature_2 = ContinuousInput(key="x2", bounds=[-5, 5])
```

For more details on `Input` features, see the respective sections in our [docs](https://experimental-design.github.io/bofire/).


### Defining the optimization domain

In BoFire's terminology, `Domain` objects fully describe the search space of the optimization problem. `Input` and `Output` features are optionally bound with `Constraint` objects to specify allowed relationships between the parameters. Here, we will run an unconstrained optimization. For more details, see the respective sections in our [docs](https://experimental-design.github.io/bofire/).

```Python
from bofire.data_models.domain.api import Domain, Inputs, Outputs


domain = Domain(
    inputs=Inputs(features=[input_feature_1, input_feature_2]),
    outputs=Outputs(features=[output_feature]),
)
```

### Draw candidates and execute experiments

Let's define the Himmelblau's function to evaluate points in the domain space.

```Python
def himmelblau(x1, x2):
    return (x1**2 + x2 - 11) ** 2 + (x1 + x2**2 - 7) ** 2
```

To initialize an iterative Bayesian optimization loop, let's first randomly draw 10 samples from the domain. In BoFire's terminology, those suggested samples are called `Candidates`.

```Python
candidates = domain.inputs.sample(10, seed=13)

print(candidates)
```
```plaintext
>           x1        x2
>  0  1.271053  1.649396
>  1 -5.012360 -1.907210
>  2 -4.541719  5.609014
>  3  ...       ...
```

Let's evaluate the function output for the randomly drawn candidates using the `himmelblau` function to obtain `Experiments` in BoFire's terminology.

```Python
experimental_output = candidates.apply(
    lambda row: himmelblau(row["x1"], row["x2"]), axis=1
)

experiments = candidates.copy()
experiments["y"] = experimental_output

print(experiments)
```

```plaintext
>           x1        x2           y
>  0  1.271053  1.649396   68.881387
>  1 -5.012360 -1.907210  219.383137
>  2 -4.541719  5.609014  628.921615
>  3 ...        ...       ...
```

For more details on candidates and experiments, see the respective sections in our [docs](https://experimental-design.github.io/bofire/).


### Defining an optimization strategy

Let's specify the strategy how the Bayesian optimization campaign should be conducted. Here, we define a single-objective Bayesian optimization strategy and pass the optimization domain together with a acquisition function. Here, we use logarithmic expected improvement `qLogEI` as the acquisition function. In BoFire's terminology, we create a serializable data model `SoboStrategy` which we then map to our functional model.

```Python
import bofire.strategies.api as strategies
from bofire.data_models.acquisition_functions.api import qLogEI
from bofire.data_models.strategies.api import SoboStrategy


sobo_strategy_data_model = SoboStrategy(
    domain=domain, acquisition_function=qLogEI(), seed=19
)

sobo_strategy = strategies.map(sobo_strategy_data_model)
```

For more details on strategy data models and functional models, see the respective sections in our [docs](https://experimental-design.github.io/bofire/).


### Run the optimization loop

To run the optimization loop using BoFire's terminology, we first `tell` the strategy object about the experiments we have already executed.

```Python
sobo_strategy.tell(experiments=experiments)
```

We run the optimization loop for 30 iterations. In each iteration, we `ask` the strategy object to suggest one new candidate, which is returned as a list containing a single item. We then perform a new experiment by evaluating the Himmelblau function output of this candidate. After completing the experiment, we add the new data to our existing experiments and `tell` the strategy object about the updated dataset. This process is repeated for each of the 30 iterations.

```Python
for _ in range(30):
    new_candidates = sobo_strategy.ask(candidate_count=1)

    new_experiments = new_candidates.copy()
    new_experiments["y"] = new_candidates.apply(
        lambda row: himmelblau(row["x1"], row["x2"]), axis=1
    )

    sobo_strategy.tell(experiments=new_experiments)
```

The optimization behavior of the strategy is shown in the animated figure below. The four minima are marked red, the experiments carried out are marked blue with blue lines connecting them. The contours are indicating the predicted mean of the current model of each iteration.
